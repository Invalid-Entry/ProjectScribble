# ProjectScribble
Code for a completely home-made V wall plotter.

This repo is a bit of a mono-repo containing multiple sub-projects and libraries.
Because its a prototyping project, various extra libraries are needed.

# Code

* `Arduino/` Contains the code that goes onto the arduino
* `Notebooks/` Contains various Jupyter notebooks that were used in prototyping

# Running the code

* Need an arduino mega, with a ramps shield, and the Accelstepper lib.
* Notebooks require various libraries (such as PIL), but should be used for reference.
